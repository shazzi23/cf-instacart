# Instacart Basket Analysis
This repository contains code extracts from a **data analysis project** I worked on as part of the [Career Foundry](https://careerfoundry.com/) Data Analytics Bootcamp.

Please note, although Instacart is a real company that has made their data available online, the contents of this project brief have been fabricated for the purpose of learning.

## Project Brief
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. In this project, I have analysed by buying patterns in relation to customer characteristics to support improved promotion targeting and marketing spend.

Key questions/requests from the marketing team include:
- What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?
- Are ther particular times of the day when people spend the most money?
- Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders?
- How often do users return to Instacart?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
- What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?

## Learning outcomes
The main purpose of this project was to develop my knowledge of **Python** and to familiarise myself with platforms such as **Jupyter**.
